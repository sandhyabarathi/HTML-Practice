    <h1>World's Best Lasagna</h1>
    <p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Don’t get me wrong, there are so many ways to make a classic Italian lasagna, but I think people have run too far with the changes, and it no longer resembles anything remotely Italian-style (like so many American-Italian dishes). Even within Italy there are so many variations (more to come)! While lasagna Bolognese is probably the most famous and original, this is a Southern Italian recipe. So if you want a lasagna that’s packed with a laundry list of ingredients including: sausage (with ground beef), ricotta (or worse yet, cottage cheese), sour cream, sugar, Italian seasoning, and other crazy ingredients that you’d never find in authentic Italian lasagna, you better find another recipe, because this is not it.</p>
