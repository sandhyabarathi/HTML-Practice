    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fried morels, where have you been all my life? Seriously. I have eaten morels for decades, but only recently have I experienced the glory of the fried morel. I am not looking back.

        Frying morels in flour, breading or batter is the go-to method of eating these most coveted of springtime mushrooms for most of North America. But not where I live, in the Pacific West.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>fresh morels</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper</li>
        <li>onion powder</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>Lard, butter or vegetable oil</li>  
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to created: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice large morels in half lengthwise and keep small ones whole. Drop the mushrooms into a bowl of cool water and shake them around a bit to let any debris fall out of the little nooks and crannies in them. Remove from the water and pat dry with paper towels</li>
        <li>Put the flour and all the seasonings in a bowl. Whisk together the milk and eggs in another bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour enough oil, or lard or butter, into a large sauté pan to come up about 1/2 inch. You are shallow-frying your morels, like when you fry chicken. Heat this to at least 325°F and I prefer 350°F.</li>
        <li>As the oil is heating, dust the morels in the seasoned flour. When the oil is hot, dip enough morels to fit into your sauté pan -- in one layer without touching each other -- into the egg wash, then into the flour once more. Shake off the excess flour and fry. You want the morels to be fully cooked so fry them for at least 3 to 4 minutes per side, adjusting the heat so they don't burn. If your heat's at the right spot, it all should sound like frying bacon.</li>
        <li>When they're done, move the morels to a paper towel to drain. If you have a lot of morels to fry, put the paper towel in a baking sheet and set that in the oven set to "warm." Serve your morels with lemon wedges and lots of beer.</li>
    </ol>
